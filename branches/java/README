ISEE requires third party jar files which were free to download at the time ISEE
was started. For some jar files, the licence has changed since ISEE was started,
so that it is not clear if they may be provided with the ISEE source.

Each library will be checked, and if the current version of the licence allows
its distribution, it will be added with its licence to the lib directory. 

The libraries are:

crimson-1.1.3.jar
epsgraphics.jar
jcommon-1.0.0-rc1.jar
jfreechart-1.0.0-rc1.jar
jreleaseinfo-1.3.0.jar
JSAP-2.1.jar
ledatastream.jar
log4j-1.2.8.jar
svninfo_task.jar
